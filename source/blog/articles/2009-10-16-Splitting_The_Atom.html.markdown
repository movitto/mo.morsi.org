<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_attack">Massive Attack</a> (perhaps the best band in the world :-D) just released an EP in anticipation for their (hopefully) soon to be released LP (I say hopefully as they've been delaying the release for over 4 years now).

As with all their other work this latest EP, titled "Splitting The Atom" is phenominal. Check out the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93UelQGyKs8">title track</a>
