(Sorry for the lack of updates to this blog, been very busy, hopefully will post some new content in the near future, but no guarantees)

Attached is a spec and srpm which I am initially hosting in hopes to get the <a href="http://anyterm.org/">Anyterm</a> rpm into fedora. The idea is, is to use this in the near future in the <a href="http://ovirt.org">ovirt</a> project. Included in the anyterm source are some small changes I made to the codebase as well as the inclusion of a new spec (existing was for an older version of the project), and sysconfig / init scripts; all of which I'm also pushing to get integrated upstream in the near future. Enjoy!
