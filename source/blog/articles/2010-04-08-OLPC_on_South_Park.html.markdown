Great new episode of South Park yesterday. For anyone who missed it Facebook was the target of this weeks humor and it even had a great Tron parody thrown into the mix. 

One particular scene at the very beginning of the episode caught my attention, though I wasn't sure until my suspicions were <a href="http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/04/08/south-park-face-episode-tron/">confirmed</a>. Notice what kind of laptop Kenny (the kid in the orange coat) is using in the background:

Thats right, it's an <a href="http://laptop.org/en/">OLPC XO</a>! Apparently someone at South Park Studios is a fan!
