Came up with these about random topics over some time and figure I'd share. I'm still no expert and am learning (there seem to be a few sites on the net where people can share them).

```
Too much caution
can likely be a danger
act responsibly
```

```
Freedom is a whole
Cannot be picked and chosen
Remove one, take all
```

```
We need too leave Earth,
our ultimate ascension,
all eggs one basket
```

Among other things, Haikus are neat mental exercises you can do pertaining to any topic you may have at mind. Traditionally they are about nature but as with everything there are many variations of the art.
