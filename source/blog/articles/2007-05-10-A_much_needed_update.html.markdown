title: A much needed update

Since its been nearly two months since my last post, I believe an update is long overdue. Apologies to my non-existant blog readers, as I have been insanely busy with school and haven't had time for much else. But the semester finally finished and the fun is just beginning!!! 

I suppose the biggest news I have is that I interviewed for and was offered/accepted another internship position at Red Hat. Even better, the position is in New York City (not that Raleigh was bad, but NYC is closer to Syracuse and <b>much</b> bigger). I'm not sure of the exact details of what I am going to be doing, but I am excited neverless. I'm head down there the weekend after next, staying at Columbia University (right in the middle of midtown), and start working on the 21st.

As I mentioned before, I finally finished the three courses I was taking this semester, including Computer Security, Object Oriented Design, and Distributed Objects. I have updated the projects page to include select highlights of my work this semester. I am planning on taking Internet Programming this summer. Since it is a project based course (submitted online with no tests) and I have a ton of experience with web development (not ASP.NET unfortunately, which the class is in) I am not that worried. But to make things even more interesting I want to get a ton of work on my Master's Thesis done this summer. I have nailed down an idea and an advisor, and am currently in the process of writing an abstract. Needless to say its gonna be one busy summer (bring it on, I say)

Just to wrap up a few things mentioned previously. I bought a new cell phone, and had Verizon transfer my number (found the old one when the snow melted, but needless to say it was broke). My friend Jack is going to be ok, he got in touch with a specialist, and since the situation was still early, he got much better. Lastly, I'm still working on the Squirellmail/Drupal extensions I had previously mentioned, and ideally they will be ready by the end of the month, but no promises :-p

Anyways, as the rigerous project deadlines are a thing of the past (until next semester), I will be updating this more often, so make sure to check back!
