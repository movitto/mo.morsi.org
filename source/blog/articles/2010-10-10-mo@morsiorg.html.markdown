I'm migrating away from my Yahoo! Mail account in favor of my own mo@morsi.org. I do this for various reasons but primarily because of my distaste for yahoo's web ui and due to a <a href="http://mmcgrath.livejournal.com/37248.html">Fedora/Yahoo!</a> mail problem which I've only recently found out about. 

I did sign up for a couple years of Yahoo! Mail plus to forward all my movitto@yahoo traffic to my new address, which I will be using immediately as the replacement. I know it may seem strange to pay for the service at this point, but I'm paying it for the time being to migrate _away_ from their mail service, eventually I mean to not use it at all.

So don't be surprised if you receive mail from mo@morsi.org and I ask that people start sending mail there instead of my yahoo address. Thanks.
