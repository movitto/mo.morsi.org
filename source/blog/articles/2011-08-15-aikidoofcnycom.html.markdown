It is a phenomenal martial art, we have an amazing dojo right here in Syracuse w/ an amazing Sensai, and the physical and mental training is extremely helpful in all situations (everyday and otherwise). I highly recommend that everyone check it out, most likely there is a dojo in your area!

I'm pleased to say that I've been given the privilege of redesigning / reimplementing the <a href="http://aikidoofcny.com/">Aikido of CNY website</a> which I've just deployed this past weekend. It's still a work in progress, but the general look and feel has been established and alot more content / information has been added. I will be adding more content as I shore up the site, and tweaking the layout/workflow/design as it progresses, but am also looking for any constructive feedback that anyone may have. Any thoughts or feedback would be more than appreciated. Thanks alot!
