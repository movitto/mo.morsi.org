Not much to report about yesterday. Pretty much stayed at my friend's place all day cooking our Thanksgiving meal and then ate it. My and Dave's mutual friend and previous school-chum / senior design partner came down from Stanford (where he is working on his Master's degree) for the day, and it was a great pleasure to see and hang out w/ him. We had turkey (of course), beef, sweet potatoes, stuffing, biscuits, and pecan / pumpkin pies for desert (plus I'm probably forgetting a thing or two). We played alot of Wii ;-) as well. (Wii Sports and Fit, Super Mario Galaxy, World of Goo are all great games)

I regret not taking more pictures, I have one or two of the meal but I should have taken some w/ everyone in it. Alas nothing I could do about it, and it was a great day regardless.
