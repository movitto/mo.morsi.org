This is my second attempt at a blog, which in itself is a small part of my entire network overhaul. I've learned alot from my previous attempts, and hopefully this time around everything will go smoothly as planned and I'll get some visitors to the site ;-) Regardless, look forward to the start of commentary on a great deal of issues in the coming weeks. Hope to see you back again!
