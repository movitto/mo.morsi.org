<p align="justify">Unfortunately after one and a half years, I've misplaced my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V710">v710</a> cell phone for the first time. I really liked this phone (despite having to go through hell unlocking all the features which Verizon promoted but disabled on the phone), and really don't want to buy another, especially since my contract is up in April, after which I am planning on discontinuing my Verizon account (overpriced, and not worth it). In the meantime (until I find it or buy a new one) I will only be able to be reached via email and aim. (with my luck, its burried under the 11 feet of snow we got this week!)</p>
