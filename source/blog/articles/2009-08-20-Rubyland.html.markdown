We'll I'm back in <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby-land</a>, my next project that I'm looking to release soon will be written in that. 

I can't say I'm sad to be done w/ C++ for a little while, quite the contorary, while I still like C++ very much and it has a large place in the software world, no one can deny Ruby is just easier to write (at the expense of performance of course).

So I just whipped up a quick <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku">Haiku</a> about Ruby ;-). This is the first one I've ever written so its kinda historic (and fun, look out for more in future posts):

<pre>
Beautiful ruby
code as if you are speaking
programmer at ease
