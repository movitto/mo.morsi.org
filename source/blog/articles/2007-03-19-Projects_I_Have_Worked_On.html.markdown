title: Projects I Have Worked On

Alright, enough about what I've configured and installed (and how I did it), and onto the fun stuff; namely programming! I've uploaded several of my favorite projects, which I have worked on in my academic and professional careers as well as on my spare time, to my <a href="http://mohammed.morsi.org/blog/?q=projects">projects</a> page. Here you will be able to see some of the work I am most proud of such as the compiler for my simple language called PL, my senior level engineering project, and my IPSec implementation for Minix. 

I am also currently working on an extension to the SquirrelMail webmail client (I'm not telling what it will do yet ;-p) when I have the spare time (which is not often these days). The plugin API is similar to that of Drupal, which I have written modules for in the past (see my projects page), involving hooks and such, and thus it shouldn't take me too long to finish. Once complete, I will upload the code/documentation to my projects page as well as to the official <a href="http://squirrelmail.org">squirrelmail</a> site, and begin working on my next idea (once again, not telling what it is yet :-D)
