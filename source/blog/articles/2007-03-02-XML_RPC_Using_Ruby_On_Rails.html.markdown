<p align="justify">Just wanted to link to a wiki article I wrote as part of my internship at Red Hat. When rewriting the internal Errata Tool using the Ruby on Rails framework, one of my tasks involved porting the XMLRPC server which the errata tool provides to other applications that use errata (such as bugzilla). After looking into the topic, and writing the required web services, I wrote the following article summarizing what I learned:

<a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/HowtoWriteAXmlRpcService">How To Write An XML RPC Service</a> using Ruby On Rails.

(Also available <a href="http://www.morsi.org/wiki/index.php/XMLRPC_Using_Ruby_On_Rails">here</a> incase the previous links is taken down or vandalized)
