title: Announcing Manic Version 0.1
date: 2009-09-10

I've been working on <a href="http://projects.morsi.org/manic">Messaging And Networking In C++</a> (via <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/manic/">sourceforge</a>) for some time now in conjunction w/ <a href="http://mohammed.morsi.org/blog/?q=node/266">romic</a> and a couple other to be released projects. While there are many existing networking libraries, especially for C++, Manic distinguishes itself through its sheer simplicity and its standard and extensible interface able to be used in conjunction with any backend transmission type. Manic is licensed under the AGPL with a linker friendly provision.
