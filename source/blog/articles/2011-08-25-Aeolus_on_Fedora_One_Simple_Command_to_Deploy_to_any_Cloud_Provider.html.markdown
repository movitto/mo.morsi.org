Try this one out.

```
$ wget <a href="http://yum.morsi.org/aeolus/cloud.rb">http://yum.morsi.org/aeolus/cloud.rb</a>
$ sudo ruby cloud.rb
```

You will be prompted for cloud provider credentials, instances to create on all those providers, and repos and packages to use on those instances. All using <a href="http://aeolusproject.org">Aeolus</a> framework tooling.

Doesn't get much simpler than that huh? :-D


Also checkout the screencast of the tooling in action. It's my first screencast so its a bit rough (especially around the audio and transitions) but it should convey enough of an overview of how Aeolus currently works to get you started (feel free to ask any questions)
