<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_attack">Massive Attack</a> just released their 5th studio album, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Heligoland-Massive-Attack/dp/B002ZPIC1M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1265763609&sr=8-1">Heligoland</a>, the first in 6 years since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100th_Window">100th window</a>. One of the few artists I like enough to buy their cds brand new, nevermind on release day, I enjoy most of Massive Attack's work, including this new album. IMHO though perhaps not as good as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mezzanine_%28album%29">Mezzanine</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protection_%28album%29">Protection</a> overall, it still has a number of great tracks including <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH9HA9AI_RI">Splitting The Atom</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EatYdFw3eHo">Pray For Rain</a>, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEgX64n3T7g">Paradise Circus</a>. Definitely a playlist recommendation for anyone into this type of music.
