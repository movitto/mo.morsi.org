title: Disabled anon comments

So what I had feared had transpired, as I had just realized every post on this site was littered w/ spam comments from anonymous sources. Supposedly there is a drupal module which will filter the spam for you, but honestly I haven't much need for anonymous comments right now anyways, so I disabled it all together. If you notice anything wrong w/ any of my postings, just email me, and if I incorporate your feedback I promise to cite you as the source.

BTW to save anyone in the same situation the hassle; in order to delete all comments from your drupal database you need to not only trucate the 'comments' table but also the 'node_comments_statistics' table, else the comments will be gone but you'll still see 'xyz comments' under each post on your front page.
