I'm in the process with several other individuals in the area of trying to form a <a href="http://hackerspaces.org">Hackerspace</a> for the Syracuse region. Hackerspaces have been successful in smaller cities than Syracuse, so there is no reason we shouldn't be able to get it going, but like many new ventures, we are having some trouble getting it off the ground, namely raising enough funds / pledges to pay for the minimum setup we need. We already found a suitable location for the group, but obviously anything is out of the question without enough rent money, and I was just wondering if anyone had any tip / tricks / advice to give pertaining to getting these going and raising enough funds to pay for the day to day operations.  

If you've got any tidbits to add feel free to leave a comment here or send me an email, and if your interested in staying up to date with the discussion pertaining to the Hackerspace, shout out and I'll add you to the mailing list we currently have. Also be sure to check out the preliminary <a href="http://hackerspace.morsi.org/">site</a> I put together for the group.
