Just finished unorphaning, packaging,  and submitting <a href="http://jruby.org">JRuby</a> for <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=561484">Fedora</a>. There were 13 Java packages (JRuby and 12 dependencies) that had to be updated and submitted, and getting them all in might take some time, but what's there is working, most packages build on Koji fine and the rest depend on other packages in the set that have to make it into the repos first. I've done quite a bit of Java work in the past (RIP <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mrlogistics/">Mr. Logistics</a>!) but wouldn't say I'm a guru so if something is amiss feel free to comment in Bugzilla.

During this process I also looked into packaging <a href="http://maglev.gemstone.com/">Maglev</a>, a cool new ruby interpreter that runs as a persistent server, which an end user's Ruby processes / vms running on any machine can connect to in order to manage objects and run code. No database backend is required, all persistence is done in the server and thus it scales very nicely and is highly optimized/fast (see this <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2010/01/15/distributed-ruby-with-the-maglev-vm/">good article</a> for more info). Unfortunately Maglev is still alpha and the build / install system is somewhat unconventional (neither of which is a problem for packaging for Fedora) but additionally the <a href="http://github.com/MagLev/maglev/tree/master/Licenses/">licensing situation</a> is currently fairly messy and I'm not fully sure how compliant it is w/ the <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/LicensingGuidelines">Fedora Licensing Guidelines</a>. I'm going to keep track of this and potentially see what can be done if things change.

So for today, only one Ruby interpreter :-D All in all the following are the packages which need to be approved (those w/ a * next to them depend on other packages in the set). Fedora/Jython should also be able to benefit from these packages, as the newer versions of jython depend on some of these as well.

If anyone is interested in helping out w/ any aspect of the Fedora/Ruby integration feel free to join the discussion on the <a href="http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/ruby-sig/">ruby-sig</a> mailing list (particularly regarding supporting the various versions of Ruby and gems). Enjoy!
