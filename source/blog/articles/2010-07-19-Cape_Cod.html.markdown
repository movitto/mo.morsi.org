Took a trip with the family to  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod">Cape Cod</a> this past weekend. It wasn't my first time there, I went a couple of times when I was younger, but it was the first in at least 10 years.

While I brought my camera, I regret not taking more pictures of the beautiful scenery. I only grabbed a couple of snapshots at the last beach we went to, <a href="http://www.nps.gov/caco/planyourvisit/nauset-light-beach.htm">Nauset Light Beach</a> right before leaving. Regardless, I highly recommend the cape for a vacation, there are some gorgeous beaches and plenty to do for people of all ages.

Enjoy!
