I will be attending <a href="http://fosscon.org/">FOSSCON</a> this Saturday at RIT, about an hr away from Syracuse. I plan on carpooling with a few friends I know from the <a href="http://www.syrlug.org/">Syrlug</a>, but there may be more seats available (I can't guarantee this though). So if your in the Syr area and am interested in attending, send me an email and I'll see what the situation is.
