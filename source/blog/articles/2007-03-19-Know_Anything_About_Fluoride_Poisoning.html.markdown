title: Know Anything About Fluoride Poisoning?

I recently found out that a good friend of mine <a href="http://jaboutboul.blogspot.com/index.html">Jack Aboutboul</a> has recently started suffering from a condition known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride_poisoning">Fluoride Poisoning</a>. Details are scarce, but the condition is serious, and he is in the process of gathering information and figuring out his options. He is asking that anyone who knows a bit about this condition, treatment options, contact him. If you know anything that might be helpful, please contact him at jaa at redhat dot com or me at movitto at yahoo dot com (I will forward all info immediately). Any help is greatly appreciated. 

<b>edit</b>: It seems like Jack found a source of the information that he was looking for, and the situation is now under control. Definitely dodged a bullet on that one. Best of luck Jack!
