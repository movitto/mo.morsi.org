I also have a minimal set of slides which I've uploaded <a href="http://mo.morsi.org/files/presentations/mmorsi-olf2012-aeolus-slides.pdf">here</a> (original showoff <a href="http://mo.morsi.org/files/presentations/mmorsi-olf2012-aeolus-slides.tgz">source</a> and <a href="http://mo.morsi.org/files/presentations/mmorsi-olf2012-aeolus-commands">commands</a>).

And thats about it! I head out in a short bit for my 7hr drive there (stopping in Buffalo) and back on Sunday. On Friday, I'm scheduled to present in the <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/bacd">first slot</a> at the 'Build A Cloud' Day, and then on saturday my OLF talk is <a href="http://www.ohiolinux.org/saturday">at 3pm</a> in room C110-112. Everyone who can make it is welcome to attend, and I'll try to take some photos and post from the conference but there is always a million things going on so no promises! :-)

Take care!
