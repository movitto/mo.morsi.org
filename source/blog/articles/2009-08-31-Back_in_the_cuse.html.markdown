So for anyone that didn't know (which is pretty much anyone I didn't personally tell) I was living in the Boston area this past summer, and working out of an office RH has near there. Adding it to the list, this brings the cities that I've lived in or at least seen a substantial part of when visiting to Syracuse, Cairo Egypt, Raleigh NC, NYC, San Franciso CA, Boston MA.

I've also been to Washington DC, Montreal, Toronto, San Jose, the Amsterdam Airport :-) and a slew of other places, but I didn't stay / visit for long and don't have much of a recollection.

They say home is where the heart is. Say what you want about Syracuse (and believe me there are a million crappy things about living here........ though the same number if not more good things) it's still my favorite place to live :-)
